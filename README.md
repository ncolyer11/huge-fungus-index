# huge-fungus-index
contains the probabilities of a stem, shroomlight and wart block generating for every individual block for every valid trunk height and hat height configuration

will eventually write some more code to process and filter all this data to derive some insanely useful information such as a 'huge fungus heatmap' that visually displays the areas within the 7x7x27 volume of a nether tree that are most likely to generate shroomlights, wart blocks and stems
